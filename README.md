# Viral attenuation of phiX174 bacteriophage

To investigate how codon choice and mRNA folding stability affect viral fitness, we built phiX viruses with altered codon preference and mRNA folding stability characteristics.

The code and data provided here was used to:
1. Computationally recode phiX174 genes.
2. Analyze properties of recoded genes.
3. Compare resulting fitness measurements of synthetic phiX174 viruses.
